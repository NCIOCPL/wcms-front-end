<div id="cc1" style="clear:both;"><sup>1</sup> NCI-designated cancer centers are institutions dedicated to research in the development of more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. There are three types: Cancer Centers, Comprehensive Cancer Centers, and Basic Laboratory Centers. Cancer Centers must demonstrate scientific leadership, resources, and capabilities in some combination of laboratory, clinical, or population science. Comprehensive Cancer Centers must demonstrate reasonable depth and breadth of research in each of three major areas: laboratory, clinical, and population-based research, as well as substantial transdisciplinary research that bridges these scientific areas. Basic Laboratory Cancer Centers conduct only laboratory research and do not provide patient treatment. There is a total of 68 NCI-designated Cancer centers; 20 Cancer Centers, 41 Comprehensive Cancer Centers, and 7 Basic Laboratory Cancer Centers.</div>
