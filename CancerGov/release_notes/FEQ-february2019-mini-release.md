# FEQ February 2019 Mini Release

## [WCMSFEQ-1240] PDQ right rail removal
This removes the right rail navigation from PDQ pages as well as the routie.js library and supporting script. Adding new "On This Page" and "In This Section" navigation generation features to help navigate the larger PDQ pages. This is an important pre-migration task as the routie.js feature would not work in a Drupal environment.

## [WCMSFEQ-1241] PDQ Page OTP + In This Section Implementation
Adding new features to draw "On This Page" and "In This Section" navigation menus throughout the PDQ page to assist with navigation on these very long pages.

## [WCMSFEQ-1335] Remove 'In This Section' from 'About PDQ Summary' section
The 'About this PDQ Summary' section of a PDQ page should not have the 'In This Section' navigation that the other headers take on.

## [WCMSFEQ-1242] PDQ Redesign Analytics
Updating 'On This Page' and 'In This Section' analytics for PDQ pages

## [WCMSFEQ-1330] Create full width on centered call out box on DCEG
Adding some new styles for DCEG blocks and callout boxes.
