## [WCMSFEQ-1105] Refactor AMD and UMD Modules into ES6 modules
### (NO CONTENT CHANGES)

This represents a massive refactor of some 75 js files. The idea is to deprecate the use of require.js/AMD style modules (and UMD where unnecessary) in favor of ES6 modules (import/export). This is not a full refactor, but many singletons needed to be fixed and in a few other cases (eg a lingering global assignment) code was cleaned up minorly. In addition, the API for some imports changed and this is reflected in the changes to Common.js most clearly. A few files have not been converted, either because they are already deprecated and awaiting deletion or because they are jquery-ui extensions and would be a more substantial undertaking for less obvious gains.
