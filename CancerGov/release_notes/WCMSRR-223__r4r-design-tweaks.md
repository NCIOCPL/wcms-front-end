# [WCMSRR-223] Release Notes
### (NO CONTENT CHANGES)

This release is for basic design tweaks. The bulk of the changes occured as part of an r4r update and this is only to update the FEQ r4r dependency. One change was made locally, to remove the custom override of a link which caused it to be displayed as a cgov arrow link.
