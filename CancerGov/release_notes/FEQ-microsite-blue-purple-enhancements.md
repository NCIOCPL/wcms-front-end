# Microsites Enhancements April 2019

## Summary
The main focus of this release was to continue updating the Blue and Purple palettes. We also added Nano to the sites using the Blue palette. The Blue palette will be the template going forward. Purple is stil using its own code and will soon need to change to using the Blue template. In addition to the microsite tickets (well over 50), there were tickets to do DLP overrides and to update the Spanish Dictionary Widget.
