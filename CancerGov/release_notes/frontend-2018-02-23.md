>This is a prototype for future releases. Each release will have it's own file to track manual change steps. 
At the moment, manual changes and code changes are coordinated by pen and pencil. The hope is to have our version control system also track manual changes. Please update this file with each feature branch pull request so that it is clear to whomever is responsible for making the changes which manual changes are required, the person requesting them, and the codebase changes they are intended for. In the same vein, if you need to make manual changes without code changes, create a feature branch, edit the current release file with the manual steps, and make a PR. That way everything is tracked and future release build documentation will write itself iteratively. This file should be consistent with the necessary build steps outlines we write in Collaborate.

 ### about-nci/organization raw html changes [WCMSFEQ-927]

In percussion/cancergov (not cancergov_configuration), the file cancergov/about-nci/organization/NCI Organization [#3706] needs to have it's raw HTML changed to remove Images and add new classnames to the ```<a/>``` tags wrapping the images. 

This change is currently reflected in the mock/nci-organization.html file. Replacing the ```<div class="nci-organization"></div>``` with the following snippet will suffice:

```
                    <div class="nci-organization">
                        <p>As the nation's leading federal agency for cancer research, NCI has 30 divisions, offices, and centers who work together
                            to build, maintain, and enhance a cohesive and comprehensive cancer research agenda. Their work ranges from cutting-edge
                            research on cancer causes, treatment, and prevention; to training the next generation of cancer researchers; to funding
                            and supporting the nation's vast network of scientists and cancer research institutions; to informing and educating

### Dictionary Widget JS changes [WCMSFEQ-833]

A grunt task has been added to uglify the Dictionary Widget code and have it output in our js dist folder (in it's own subdirectory).
This is not a manual change per se, but because the TermDictionaryWidgetInnards has not been a part of our typical workflow, I want to make a note to manually add it. (in truth it likely won't be changed very often and can largely be ignored until the next time).


### Footer Content Block Changes ENGLISH
