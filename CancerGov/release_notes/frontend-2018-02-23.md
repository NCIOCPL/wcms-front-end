>This is a prototype for future releases. Each release will have it's own file to track manual change steps. 
At the moment, manual changes and code changes are coordinated by pen and pencil. The hope is to have version control system also track manual changes so please update this file with each feature branch pull request so that it is clear to whomever is responsible which manual changes are required, the person requesting them, and the codebase changes they are intended for. In the same vein, if you need to make manual changes without code changes, create a feature branch, edit the current release file with the manual steps, and make a PR. That way everything is tracked and future release build documentation will write itself iteratively. This file should be consistent with the necessary build steps detailing we do in Collaborate.

### about-nci/organization raw html changes

* In percussion/cancergov (not cancergov_configuration), the file cancergov/about-nci/organization/NCI Organization [#3706] needs to have it's raw HTML changed to remove Images and add new classnames to the a tags wrapping the images. This change is currently reflected in the mock/nci-organization.html file. Replacing the ```<div class="nci-organization"></div>``` with the following snippet will suffice:

```
