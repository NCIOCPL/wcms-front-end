#Frontend-2018-07-20: FEQ Bucket Release (508 and Architecture Tickets)

TBD...

##  [WCMSFEQ-1063] Roll ContentPage into Common

Instead of two global js files being requested on each page, we will only have one. Other tickets will ideally pare this file down.

Content changes are required to make sure all the Percussion templates are no longer slotting in ContentPage.
