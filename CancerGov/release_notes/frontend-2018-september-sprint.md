# Frontend-2018: FEQ September Release

## [WCMSFEQ-1114] White Space on Landing Pages 
### (NO CONTENT CHANGES)

Since there is no content in the multimedia slot of the About Cancer, El Cancer, Investigacion, Subvenciones-Capacitacion, and Nuestro Instituto landing pages, they all have an extra white space between the last multimedia card and the footer.  Removed the bottom margin in the multimedia slot to alleviate the white space.
  * Used psuedo selector to target just the last set of cards on the page
  * Corrects the same issue on NCI connect guide card row
  * Note: The last-SI class is generated by Percussion and may need revisiting with the new CMS

## [WCMSFEQ-###] Ticket Title
