At 1024px breakpoint, the Section Menu was defaulting to an open state and showing the submenu that it contains.  This was occurring on every page that invokes the Section Menu Nav button, not just the Cancer Currents Blog page.
  * Set min-width for the section menu resizeHandler to 1025px to prevent the section menu navigation from defaulting to open at the 1024px breakpoint
